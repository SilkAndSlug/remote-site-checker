Remote-Site-Checker crawls the given URL, logging HTTP errors (e.g. 404 not-found) and PHP errors (e.g. Fatal Error).

It accepts parameters from the command line, or from a config file.

It's written in BASH, and is suitable for running under Cron - great for checking clients' sites for broken links and more!
